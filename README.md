# A Laser-based Volumetric Measurement Approach for Industrial Settings
This repository complements our publication "A Laser-based Volumetric Measurement Approach for Industrial Settings", soon to be published in IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) 2024.

The repository provides further insight into our experimental section and contains the following:
- The calibration approach ('calibration' folder)
- The resulting images taken during our experiments ('image-series' folder)
- The numerical results of the experiments as an excel sheet ('MeasurementResultsAndTiming.xlsx')
- The main script used to conduct the experiments ('batch-analyse.py')
- The required dependencies ('requirements.txt')
